        What It Does
\nDevelops power in the chest, triceps, and shoulders.

\n\nHow to Do It
\nFrom a standard push-up position, lower your chest until it’s slightly below the level of your bent elbow, and then push upward with enough force so that your hands leave the ground by a few inches. Land with soft elbows in push-up form and continue the lowering motion toward the ground. Repeat. Make sure to keep your back flat and hips level throughout the movement.

\n\nClaps (Harder): Once you get a handle on power push-ups, you can progress the exercise by adding in claps, which require more power to achieve the necessary airtime. For regular clap push-ups, perform a power push-up but with even more upward force. While your hands are in the air, clap below your chest. Like before, land with soft elbows in push-up form and continue lowering until your chest is slightly below the level of your bent elbow. Repeat.

       It is an excellent option to build your triceps without weights or equipment. Since this movement is basically a press down extension, the short (outside) head becomes most engaged as the arms extend or straighten.

\n\nPerformance Tips:
\n1. Whether utilizing the full plank position or modified on your knees, be sure to use an engaged core, with tight abs, hips slightly elevated, and glutes squeezed.
\n2. Breath out on the way up.
\n3. This can be an especially challenging exercise in both the full plank position and modified with the knees on the floor.  If you are unable to perform either of those options, begin by leaning against a wall. The closer your feet are to the wall, the easier the movement will be.

        What It Does
\nStrengthens the upper body and core, with more focus on the triceps.
\n\nHow to Do It
\nBegin in a plank position, with your hands together and angled inward at 45 degrees so that your index fingers and thumbs touch to form a triangle (or diamond). Keep your elbows tight to your body and bend them to lower your chest toward the triangle. Reverse the movement to the starting position for one repetition. Keep the triangle directly below your chest throughout the movement.

        The decline pushup is a variation of the basic pushup. It’s done with your feet on an elevated surface, which puts your body at a downward angle.
        n\nStep-by-step instructions
\nYou’ll need a raised surface like bench, box, or chair to do decline pushups.

\nThe higher the surface, the harder the exercise will be. If you’re new to decline pushups, start with a low surface, like a curb or step. You can increase the height over time.

\n\n1.Kneel down with your back to the bench. Put your hands on the floor, shoulders over your wrists and elbows at 45 degrees. Place your feet on top of the bench.
\n2.Brace your core, glutes, and quads. Bend your elbows and lower your chest to the floor, keeping your back and neck straight.
\n3.Push into the floor to return to starting position, extending your elbows.
\n4.Stop doing this exercise if you feel pain in your wrists, elbows, or shoulders.

        To perform an incline pushup:

\n1.Stand in front of your box or bench, then squat or bend down and place both hands on either side of it with your fingers pointing forward. Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart. If you need a wider piece of equipment to safely elevate yourself, don’t be shy about swapping it out.
\n2.Once your hands are in the right position, step your body back into a plank position, one leg at a time. Make sure your body is in a straight line, your head is aligned with your spine, and that your lower back isn’t sagging before continuing. Looking a few inches ahead of you, rather than down at the box, can help keep your body straight.
\n3.Next, bend your arms to help you slowly lower your chest toward the box. Straighten your arms to bring yourself back up into a straight line.
\n4.Repeat 10 times for 3 sets to start. You can increase the repetitions within each set as you get stronger.

        \n\nTo try this drill:
        \n1.Begin by standing with your feet about hip-distance apart, with your arms at your side.
        \n2.Slowly bring your right heel to your buttocks by contracting your hamstring muscle.
        \n3.Place the ball of your right foot back on the ground, and slowly bring your left heel to your buttocks.
        \n4.Perform this motion a few more times — alternating heels and gradually building speed.
        \n5.When you’re ready, continue alternating your right and left heels, picking up your pace until it feels like you’re jogging in place.
        \n6.To work your upper body at the same time, pump your arms while performing this motion. If your left heel is kicking your buttocks, pump your right arm forward at a 90-degree angle. If your right heel is kicking, pump your left arm forward.
        \n7.Continue the drill for at least 30 seconds, focusing on quick leg turnover.
        \n8.You can increase the duration as you build your fitness.

    <string name="sb_kneeling_back_rotation_right_desc">How to do the Kneeling Back Rotation Stretch:
        \n\nKneel on the ground and raise one arm. Then rotate your shoulders and middle back while looking upwards. Keep your arm pointing straight upwards and follow your hand with your eyes. This will help to further extend the stretch into your neck. Hold the stretch position for a minimum of 20 seconds and then repeat with the opposite arm.
